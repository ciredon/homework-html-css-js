    <h1> Parkour !?

    <p id="p1">
        Parkour is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.
        Practitioners, called tracers or traceurs, aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. 
        Parkour includes running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.
        Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative martial art.

        Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere.
        Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.

    <p id="p3">
        Parkour as a type of movement was established by David Belle in the late 1980s, therefore many consider its origin to be France, however this type of movement has also been practiced by people in other European countries like Latvia and Russia during the same period of time.

        According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. 
        Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it". Ch√¢u Belle explains it is a "type of freedom" or "kind of expression"; that parkour is "only a state of mind" rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers.

        While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others, and there are a number of movements considered fundamental. 
        Some examples of common movements are:
        <ol>
            <li>Vaulting over obstacles</li>
            <li>"Precision" Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles</li>
            <li>"Arm Jumps" Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands</li>
            <li>Using a rolling motion to help absorb impacts from larger drops</li>
            <li>Running towards a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall</li>
            <li>Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or over to the other side</li>
        </ol>
